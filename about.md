I'm a biologist. My research focuses on analysing and modelling bacterial evolution. I'm particularly interested in the genetics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

I'm currently based at the University of Bristol. Before that I was a Sir Henry Wellcome postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biology, Oxford (2021-2025). I did my PhD in Computational Biology at UCL (2018).
