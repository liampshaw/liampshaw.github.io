I'm a computational biologist. My research focuses on analysing and modelling bacterial communities. I'm particularly interested in the genetics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).

Currently I'm a Sir Henry Wellcome postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biology, Oxford. Before that I did a PhD in Computational Biology at UCL.
