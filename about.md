I'm a computational biologist. My research focuses on analysing and modelling bacterial communities. I'm particularly interested in the genetics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  

As of 20th August 2018 I work in the Modernising Medical Microbiology consortium in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford.
