I'm a computational biologist. My [research](http://liampshaw.github.io/research/) focuses on analysing and modelling bacterial communities. I'm particularly interested in the genetics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). From January 2021 I will be based in the Department of Zoology, University of Oxford.
