  <p>
I'm a biologist. My research focuses on analysing and modelling bacterial       evolution. I'm particularly interested in the genetics of antimicrobial         resistance (AMR).

  <p>
I'm currently based at the University of Bristol. Before that I was a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biology, Oxford (2021-2025).  I did my PhD in Computational Biology at UCL (2018).
