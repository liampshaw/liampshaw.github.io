  <p>
I'm a biologist based at the University of Bristol. I research bacterial evolution, particularly the genetics of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).
  </p>
  <p>
Before coming to Bristol I was a Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biology, Oxford (2021-2025). Before that, I did my PhD in Computational Biology at UCL (2018).
</p>
<p>
Alongside my academic research, I <a href="">write</a> about science. My first book, <i>Dangerous Miracle</i>, is being published in late 2025.
