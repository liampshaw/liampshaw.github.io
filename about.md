Hello! I'm a computational biologist. My research focuses on analysing and modelling bacterial communities. I'm particularly interested in the development and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR).  
 
 
As of 20th August 2018 I work in the Modernising Medical Microbiology consortium in the Nuffield Department of Medicine, University of Oxford. I'm trying to understand the spread of AMR between humans, animals, and the environment within Oxfordshire.

I completed my PhD at UCL in the Computational Biology Group (2014-2018) after an MRes in Modelling Biological Complexity (2013-2014). Prior to this, I did an undergraduate degree in physics (2009-2013). 

I have a (sparse) academic website [here](http://ucl.ac.uk/~ucbpsha).
