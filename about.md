Hello! I'm a computational biology PhD student at UCL. Iâ€™m based between the [Institute of Child Health](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/ich) and the [Computational Biology Group](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computational-biology-group). My PhD focuses on analysing and modelling the ways microbial communities within our bodies affect health. I'm particularly interested in complex situations like in immunocompromised children after bone marrow transplants. More generally, I think the rapid pace of developments in quantitative biology as we accumulate more and more data is cool. 
 
After a 4 year undergraduate degree in physics at Oxford I then did a Masters in 'Modelling Biological Complexity' at UCL CoMPLEX in 2014.

I have a (sparse) academic website [here](http://ucl.ac.uk/~ucbpsha) and a [blog](https://lpshaw.wordpress.com), which I'm in the process of migrating to this website.
