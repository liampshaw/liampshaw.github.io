### Bacterial genomics

The increasing availability of complete bacterial genomes allows the investigation of the processes which underpin bacterial evolution. I'm particularly interested in the spread of mobile genetic elements which move ['horizontally'](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03205-z) across bacterial genomes and even species, and untangling this nested genetic complexity. These elements includes plasmids as well as smaller transposons which can carry genes for antimicrobial resistance.

### Microbial ecology

The human microbiome is the collective name given to the microbial communities that live in our bodies. During my PhD, I applied statistical and mathematical models to understand the factors that influence the microbiome's composition, both in [health](https://doi.org/10.1128/mBio.01237-17) and [disease](https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01756-16).  One topic that I'm still interested in is understanding the effect of antibiotics: how they disrupt microbial communities and how the community [recovers](https://doi.org/10.1101/222398).

### Antimicrobial resistance

The above interests combine in my current research focus: understanding the processes behind the development and subsequent spread of antimicrobial resistance. This can be at multiple scales, from [within patients](https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciz069) to [global spread](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-03205-z).  I've also been involved in efforts to improve the availability of surveillance data of antimicrobial resistance, including carrying out work awarded a [Data Reuse Prize](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12864-019-5782-2) by Wellcome.  

## Other interests

I enjoy learning things about new areas outside my main research interests through collaboration: some papers in this category have included [host-pathogen biology](https://doi.org/10.1101/670315), [science and technology studies](https://doi.org/10.1002/geo2.66), and [yeast genetics](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms14061).

### Writing

I co-write a regular *Science and Society* column in the [Morning Star](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/author/science-and-society) and have written for the [London Review of Books blog](https://www.lrb.co.uk/blog/author/liam-shaw). Recently I also wrote about the statistics of [V-1s in WWII](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2019.01315.x).
