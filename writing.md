I sometimes write pieces for the *London Review of Books*: [here](https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/liam-shaw).

I co-write a fortnightly science column in the *Morning Star*: [here](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/author/science-and-society).

I've also written statistical analyses of [V-1s in WWII](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2019.01315.x) and [coughs on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire](https://medium.com/@liam.philip.shaw/a-statistical-analysis-of-coughing-patterns-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-187be5cc6af1).
