I sometimes write pieces for the *LRB*: [here](https://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/liam-shaw).

I co-write a fortnightly science column in the *Morning Star*: [here](https://morningstaronline.co.uk/author/science-and-society).

If you're bored, I've also written a detailed statistical analysis of [coughs on Who Wants To Be a Millionaire](https://medium.com/@liam.philip.shaw/a-statistical-analysis-of-coughing-patterns-on-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire-187be5cc6af1).
